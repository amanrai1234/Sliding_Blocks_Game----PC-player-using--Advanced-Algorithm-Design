Running of program:

we have two python files named AStar and bfs, we can run those
files either by double clicking the files(this is possible when we have 
python 3.8 installed in PC)

The best possible way to run this code can be in Spyder(Anaconda navigator)[I.D.E]
As I have created this file in that particular I.D.E
